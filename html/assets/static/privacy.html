<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At TapIn (we, our, us) we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. Both our mobile app and online viewing experience can be used entirely anonymously. We don’t need to know who you are to provide you with an excellent service.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with just laws, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: 
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors and Mobile users</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. These releases cannot be used to identify anyone user.</p>

<p>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. We only disclose logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to TapIn choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. Visitors who sign up for an account at TapIn.tv provide a username and may provide an email address for password recovery and emergency situations. Those who engage in transactions with TapIn – by becoming streaming partners or engage in other revenue-sharing activities – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with us. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. In general, we will not ask for any information that ties your account to you as a person unless money is being exchanged. Should you become a streaming partner and opt to donate your earnings to charity, we only ask for an email address through which we may contact you.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular streaming location on TapIn. We may display this information publicly or provide it to others. This is not personally-identifying information. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>TapIn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TapIn’s behalf or to provide services available at TapIn.tv and through our mobile application, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TapIn’s website and mobile application, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will never transfer information that you not have provided to us explicitly. <strong>TapIn will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. </strong>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TapIn discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TapIn, third parties or the public at large. If you have supplied your email address, TapIn may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TapIn. We keep this type of email to a minimum as it makes for a generally poor user experience to have to read multiple weekly emails. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to anonymize and publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. TapIn uses cookies to help TapIn identify and track visitors on the site, their usage of the TapIn.tv website, and their website access preferences (search, referral, etc.). We do not monitor users’ browsing habits off TapIn.tv. TapIn visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TapIn.tv, with the drawback that certain features of TapIn.tv may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If TapIn.tv, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that FS Stack, Inc. goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TapIn may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. Any change to this policy would have to be approved and accepted by you, the user.</p>

<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by TapIn and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>Users who upload videos to TapIn.tv from the TapIn mobile application retain rights of ownership to that video. Videos are made publicly available at TapIn.tv and there is no way for a user to restrict access to these videos. Additionally, the user’s location while taking the video is made public. At any point, a user may remove a video they have uploaded, provided they have an account. This is in order to authenticate that the person making the removal request is the user who uploaded it initially. When a video is removed from the TapIn.tv website by a user, it is then deleted from every TapIn server within seven days. </p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TapIn may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TapIn’s sole discretion. TapIn encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Notifications of change will be posted on the main TapIn.tv site and on the TapIn mobile application. If you have provided an email address, you will receive an email alerting you of changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
