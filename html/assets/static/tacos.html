<h1>The Gist</h1>
<p>We (the TapIn team) run a video sharing service and would love for you to use it. TapIn is an entirely free service which makes money through licensing content owned by those sharing it. This is important, because the product we’re selling is not personally-identifying information.</p>

<p>In return there are a few things which we feel make the user experience the best possible for all involved. Obviously, with live video, it’s impossible to predict what you’ll see. We just ask that you act in good faith to not record pornographic content. This isn’t ChatRoulette. Also, respect privacy laws. Typically, recording people in a public place is legal. Filming someone who has a reasonable expectation of privacy without their permission is almost always illegal. Respect people and their right to privacy.</p>

<p>There is a section about upgrades in the terms of use. As of now, there is no intention to offer such services, but should we offer premium services, their function is outlined in the terms. The core functionality of TapIn’s viewing and video streaming service will not cost money.</p>

<p>Below is the actual legal document you agree to by downloading our app or using our site. If you feel this summary is incomplete, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:davidt@tapin.tv">DavidT@tapin.tv</a> with what you’d add or change.</p>
